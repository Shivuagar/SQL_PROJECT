# SQL_PROJECT
Welcome to my SQL projects!

**New Wheels Project**
  An analysis of customer ratings, purchase history, revenue, shipment periods, and customer feedback data is the purpose of this SQL and Excel project, which will assess the operation of a car company and pinpoint its advantages and disadvantages in order to make suggestions for enhancement. 

  Customer preference for Chevrolet automobiles and a favorable association with declining customer evaluations and purchases from the first to the fourth quarters are among the findings. Possible factors include a quarterly rise in the number of days to ship and shipment delays. Increasing the number of Chevrolet automobiles might draw in more clients.
